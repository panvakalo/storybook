# Storybook assessment test

## Developer's notes
- there was an effort to match styling as much as possible, taken into consideration that graphics or styling rules had to be detected and retrieved from production website
- assessment was mentioning **one** storybook component, therefore there is only **one** story, even if there are multiple components existing in the project
- there hasn't been thorough effort in mimicking the tooltip behavior of the production website, only the basic functionality is provided
- there is no API involved into getting colors data, therefore I followed approach of getting data from **story props**
